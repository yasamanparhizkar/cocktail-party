# cocktail-party
A simple audio processing with MATLAB

## Description:
The human ear/brain is able to perform complex sound processing many of which are imitated and reproduced in technology. One of these capabilities is the power to focus on the sound of a specific source and extract that sound from varied background noises. This ability is an example of Auditory Scene Analysis (ASA) and is used in technology as a preprocessing for speech recognition in unconstrained auditory environments. 
In this project, a binaural recording of multiple speakers is provided. Using the theory of Head Related Transfer Functions (HRTF)[2], the voice of one given speaker is extracted from a mixed recording. The database used in this project is [The ShATR Multiple Simultaneous Speaker Corpus](http://spandh.dcs.shef.ac.uk/projects/shatrweb/#about).
